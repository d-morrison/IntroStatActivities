Consider the US judicial system:

\rgi What is the null hypothesis?
\rgs

\rgi What is the alternative hypothesis?
\rgs

\rgi The jury is presented with evidence.

|          - If the evidence is strong (beyond a reasonable doubt), the jury will find the defendant: 
\rgs

|          - If the evidence is not strong (not beyond a reasonable doubt), the jury will find the defendant: 
\rgs

To create a simulation, which hypothesis (null or alternative) do we assume is true? 
\rgs

Lower p-values indicate (stronger or weaker?) evidence (for or against?) the null hypothesis.

* 14.1

#### Reminders from previous sections {-}

$n$ = sample size

$\hat{p}$ = sample proportion

$\pi$ = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

1. Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.

2. Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
	
3. Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.

4. Compare the observed test (standardized) statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.

5. Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.
		
\rgi Also called a ‘significance test’.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size $n$ under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **wrong**.

Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **correct**.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

$\implies$ Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Significance level ($\alpha$): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of $\alpha$ include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

#### Vocabulary {-}

Null value:
\rgs

Null distribution:

How is a null distribution created in a simulation-based hypothesis test for a single proportion?

True or false:  The sign in the alternative hypothesis is based off of the researcher's question.

#### Example: Medical consultant {-}

As a reminder from section 10.1, $\hat{p} = 0.048$.

1. Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words.
\rgs
\rgs

2. Write the null and alternative hypotheses in notation.

4. How could we use cards to simulate 1 sample which assumes the null hypothesis is true?  How many blue cards --- to represent what?  How many red cards --- to represent what?  How many times would we draw a card and replace it back in the deck?  What would you record once you completed the draw-with-replacement process?

#### Reminders from previous sections {-}

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called ‘estimation’.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement $n$ times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size $n$ from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Bootstrap percentile confidence interval: An X% confidence interval made by finding the bounds of the middle X% of bootstrap statistics.
