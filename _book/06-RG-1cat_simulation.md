Consider the US judicial system:

\rgi What is the null hypothesis?
\rgs

\rgi What is the alternative hypothesis?
\rgs

\rgi The jury is presented with evidence.

|          - If the evidence is strong (beyond a reasonable doubt), the jury will find the defendant: 
\rgs

|          - If the evidence is not strong (not beyond a reasonable doubt), the jury will find the defendant: 
\rgs

To create a simulation, which hypothesis (null or alternative) do we assume is true? 
\rgs

Lower p-values indicate (stronger or weaker?) evidence (for or against?) the null hypothesis.

#### Reminders from previous sections {-}

$n$ = sample size

$\hat{p}$ = sample proportion

$\pi$ = population proportion

General steps of a hypothesis test:

1. Frame the research question in terms of hypotheses.

2. Collect and summarize data using a test statistic.
	
3. Assume the null hypothesis is true, and simulate or mathematically model a null distribution for the test statistic.

4. Compare the observed test (standardized) statistic to the null distribution to calculate a p-value.

5. Make a conclusion based on the p-value and write the conclusion in context.

Parameter: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a population.

Statistic: a value summarizing a variable(s) for a sample.

Sampling distribution: plot of statistics from 1000s of samples of the same size taken from the same population.

Hypothesis test: a process to determine how strong the evidence of an effect is.
		
\rgi Also called a ‘significance test’.

Simulation-based method: Simulate lots of samples of size $n$ under assumption of the null hypothesis, then find the proportion of the simulations that are at least as extreme as the observed sample statistic.

Null hypothesis ($H_0$): the skeptical perspective; no difference; no change; no effect; random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **wrong**.

Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): the new perspective; a difference/increase/decrease; an effect; not random chance; what the researcher hopes to prove is **correct**.

P-value: probability of seeing the observed sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

$\implies$ Lower the p-value the stronger the evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis and FOR the alternative hypothesis.

Significance level ($\alpha$): a threshold used to determine if a p-value provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not.

\rgi Common levels of $\alpha$ include 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.

Statistically significant: results are considered statistically significant if the p-value is below the significance level.

#### Vocabulary {-}

Null value:
\rgs

Null distribution:

How is a null distribution created in a simulation-based hypothesis test for a single proportion?

\rgs

True or false:  The sign in the alternative hypothesis is based off of the researcher's question.

#### Example: Medical consultant {-}

As a reminder from section 10.1, $\hat{p} = 0.048$.

1. Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words.
\rgs
\rgs

2. Write the null and alternative hypotheses in notation.

3. To simulate the null distribution, we would not be able to use coins.  Why not?

4. How could we use cards to simulate 1 sample which assumes the null hypothesis is true?  How many blue cards --- to represent what?  How many red cards --- to represent what?  How many times would we draw a card and replace it back in the deck?  What would you record once you completed the draw-with-replacement process?

#### Reminders from previous sections {-}

Confidence interval: a process to determine how large an effect is; a range of plausible values for the parameter. Also called ‘estimation’.

Bootstrapping: the process of drawing with replacement $n$ times from the original sample.

Bootstrapped resample: a random sample of size $n$ from the original sample, selected with replacement.

Bootstrapped statistic: the statistic recorded from the bootstrapped resample.

Bootstrap percentile confidence interval: An X% confidence interval made by finding the bounds of the middle X% of bootstrap statistics.
