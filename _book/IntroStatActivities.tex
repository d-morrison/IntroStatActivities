This coursepack accompanies the textbook for STAT 216: Introduction to Statistics at Montana State University. Each of the activities in this workbook is designed to target specific learning outcomes of the course, giving you practice with important statistical concepts in a group setting with instructor guidance. Bring this workbook with you to class each week, and take notes in the workbook as you would your own notes. A well-written complete workbook will provide an optimal study guide for exams! The activities are broken into three sections: pre-class, in-class, and after class. Read through the introduction for each activity and complete the pre-class questions before attending class each week. In class you will work through the in-class section with your group and instructor. After class you will complete the out of class part of the activity.

Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. Today in class you will be introduced to the following terms:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Observational units or cases
\item
  Variables: categorical or quantitative
\item
  Proportions
\item
  Graphs: frequency bar plot and relative frequency bar plot
\item
  Distribution
\end{itemize}

For more on these concepts, read Sections 1.2 and 2.1 in the textbook.

\section{Can you read ``Martian''?}\label{can-you-read-martian}}

How well can humans distinguish one ``Martian'' letter from another? In today's activity, we'll find out. When shown the two Martian letters, Kiki and Bumba, write down whether you think Bumba is on the left or on the right.
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Were you correct or incorrect in identifying Bumba?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3in}

\hypertarget{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process}{%
\subsection*{Steps of the statistical investigation process}\label{steps-of-the-statistical-investigation-process}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Steps of the statistical investigation process}

\textbf{Step 1}: The first step of any statistical investigation is to \emph{ask a research question}. In this study the research question is: can we as a class read Martian? (We will refine this later on!).

\textbf{Step 2}: To answer any research question, we must \emph{design a study and collect data}. For our question, the study consists of each student being presented with two Martian letters and asking which was Bumba. Your responses will become our observed data that we will explore.

\newpage

\textbf{Observational units} or \textbf{cases} are the subjects data are collected on. In a spreadsheet of the data set, each row will represent a single observational unit.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the observational units in this study?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.4in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  How many students are in class today? This is the \emph{sample size}.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3in}

A \textbf{variable} is information collected or measured on each observational unit or case. Each column in a data set will represent a different variable. Today we are only measuring one variable on each observational unit.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Identify the variable we are collecting on each observational unit in this study, i.e., what are we measuring on each student?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.8in}

We will look at two types of variables: \textbf{quantitative} and \textbf{categorical} (see Figure \ref{fig:types-of-variables}).

Quantitative variables are numerical measurements that can be discrete (whole, non-negative numbers) or continuous (any value within an interval). The number of pets one owns would be a discrete variable as you can not have a partial pet. GPA would be a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 4.0.

Categorical variables are data that are in groups or categories such as eye color, state of residency, or whether or not a student lives on campus. Categorical variables with a natural ordering are considered ordinal variables while those without a natural ordering are considered nominal variables. All categorical variables will be treated as nominal for analysis in this course.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/variables} 

}

\caption{Types of variables.}\label{fig:types-of-variables}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Is the variable identified in question 4 categorical or quantitative?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3in}

\newpage

\textbf{Step 3}: Once we have collected data, the next step is to \emph{summarize and visualize the data}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  How many people in your class were correct in identifying Bumba? Using the class size from question 2, calculate the proportion of students who correctly identified Bumba.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
$\mbox{proportion} = \frac{\mbox{number of students who correctly identified Bumba}}{\mbox{total number of students}}$
\end{center}

\vspace{0.7in}

The proportion in question 6 is called a \textbf{summary statistic}---a single value that summarizes the data set. It is important to note that a variable is different than a summary statistic. A \emph{variable} is measured on a \emph{single observational unit} while a summary statistic is calculated from a group of observational units. For example, the variable ``whether or not a student lives on campus'' can be measured on each individual student. In a class of 50 students we can calculate the proportion of students who live on campus, the summary statistic. Look back and make sure you wrote the variable in question 3 as a variable, NOT a summary statistic.

Looking at the data set and the summary statistic is only one way to display the data. We will also want to create a visualization or picture of the data. A \textbf{frequency bar plot} is used to display categorical data as a count or frequency. Since our variable has two levels, correct or incorrect, we will create two bars---one for each level.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\tightlist
\item
  Plot the observed class data using a frequency bar plot. Be sure to add a scale to the y-axis.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/barplot_martian} \end{center}

We can also visualize the data as a proportion in a \textbf{relative frequency bar plot}. Relative frequency is the proportion calculated for each level of the categorical variable.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{7}
\tightlist
\item
  Plot the observed class data using a relative frequency bar plot. Be sure to add a scale to the y-axis.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{images/relative_barplot_martian} \end{center}

\newpage

\textbf{Step 4}: The next step is to \emph{use statistical analysis methods to draw inferences from the data}. To answer the research question, we will simulate what \emph{could} have happened in our class given random chance, repeat that many times to understand the expected \emph{variability} between different ``randomly guessing'' classes, then compare our class's observed data to the simulation. This gives us an estimate of how often (or the probability of) the class's result would occur if students were all merely guessing, allowing us to determine if the data provides evidence that we as a class can in fact read Martian.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{8}
\item
  If humans really don't know Martian and are just guessing which is Bumba, what are the chances of getting it right?
  \vspace{0.3in}

  How could we use a coin to simulate each student ``just guessing'' which Martian letter is Bumba?
  \vspace{.9in}

  How could we use coins to simulate the entire class ``just guessing'' which Martian letter is Bumba?
  \vspace{.9in}

  How many people in your class would you expect to choose Bumba correctly just by chance? Explain your reasoning.
  \vspace{.9in}
\item
  Each student will flip a coin one time to simulate your ``guess''. Let Heads = correct, Tails = incorrect. What was the result of your one simulation?
  \vspace{.3in}

  What was the result from your class's simulation? What proportion of students ``guessed'' correctly in the simulation?
  \vspace{.3in}
\item
  If students really don't know Martian and are just guessing which is Bumba, which seems more unusual: the result from your class's \textbf{simulation} or the observed proportion of students in your class that were correct (this is your summary statistic from question 6)? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{11}
\tightlist
\item
  While your observed class data is likely far different from the simulated ``just-guessing'' class, comparing our class data to a single simulation does not give enough information. The differences seen could just be due to that set of coin flips! Let's simulate another class. Each student should flip their coin again. What was the result from your class's second simulation? What proportion of students ``guessed'' correctly in the second simulation? Create a plot to compare the two simulated results with the observed class result.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{12}
\tightlist
\item
  We still only have a couple of simulations to compare our class data to. It would be much better to be able to see how our class compared to hundreds or thousands of ``just-guessing'' classes. Since we don't want to flip coins all class period, your instructor will use a computer simulation to get 1000 trials. Fill in the following blanks to describe how we would create a simulation of random guessing with 1000 trials (repetitions).

\item
  Is it \emph{likely} that we could see our class results just by chance if everyone was just guessing? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{.5in}

\textbf{Step 5}: The next step in the statistical investigation process is to \emph{communicate the results and answer the research question}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{17}
\tightlist
\item
  Does this activity provide strong evidence that students were not just guessing at random? If so, what do you think is going on here? Can we as a class read Martian?\footnote{Reference for ``Martian alphabet'' is a TED talk given by Vilayanur Ramachandran in 2007. The synesthesia part begins at roughly 17:30 minutes: \texttt{http://www.ted.com/talks/vilayanur\_ramachandran\_on\_your\_mind}.}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

\textbf{Step 6}: The final step of any statistical investigation is to \emph{revisit and look ahead}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{18}
\tightlist
\item
  Can you think of any limitations of our study? Can you think of a new topic that might be of interest based on the results of our study?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

\hypertarget{take-home-messages}{%
\section{Take home messages}\label{take-home-messages}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In this course we will learn how to evaluate a claim by comparing observed results (classes' ``guesses'' when asked to identify Bumba) to a distribution of many simulated results under an assumption like ``blind guessing.''
\item
  Blind guessing between two outcomes will be correct only about half the time. We can create data (via computer simulation) to fit the assumption of blind guessing.
\item
  Unusual observed results will make us doubt the assumptions used to create the simulated distribution. A large number of correct ``guesses'' is evidence that a person was not just blindly guessing.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\hypertarget{out-of-class-activity}{%
\section{Out of Class Activity}\label{out-of-class-activity}}

Since this class is taught in a blended format we are only in class one day per week. During class we will complete the in-class activity from the course pack. Outside of class, students will read from the textbook, watch course videos, and complete an out-of-class activity on the other two days of class. To become familiar with the course outline, read through the syllabus, \url{https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/Syllabus/}, the day specific cohort calendar, and watch the Stat 216 Course Tour on D2L before answering the following questions.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  When are the case study discussion posts due?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  For your cohort, what day and time are the weekly assignments due on Gradescope?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  For your cohort, when is Exam 1? Exam 2?
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

In Stat 216 we will use the statistical package \texttt{R} to analyze data. Read through the instructions on the syllabus and download \texttt{R} and \texttt{RStudio\ Desktop} to your computer. If you have a Chromebook or have problems installing \texttt{R} and \texttt{RStudio\ Desktop} on your machine, you will need to use \texttt{RStudio\ Cloud} or an MSU virtual machine. Read through the preliminaries chapter in the textbook and watch the video \texttt{RStudio\_GettingStarted} on D2L -\textgreater{} Content -\textgreater{} Primary Resources before completing the following questions.

Open \texttt{RStudio} on your computer. Download the Martian Alphabet \texttt{RScript} file from D2L and open in \texttt{RStudio}. If the file does not open directly, open manually:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In \texttt{RStudio} click on File in the upper left hand corner, choose Open File, find the downloaded file.
\end{itemize}

If you are using \texttt{RStudioCloud} watch the video \texttt{RStudioCloud\_GettingStarted} on D2L -\textgreater{} Content -\textgreater{} Primary Resources to learn how to open the file in \texttt{RStudioCloud}.

In the Martian Alphabet \texttt{Rscript} file, highlight the first 10 lines of code and click run.

Throughout the semester we will use the package \texttt{tidyverse} to allow us to use chaining (see Section 1.7 in the textbook for more on this symbol \%\textgreater\%.) We will use the package ggplot2 to create graphs in \texttt{RStudio}, the package \texttt{mosaic} to use the favstats function to find summary statistics for quantitative variables, and the package \texttt{catstats} starting in Chapter 5 to create simulations. Once you have installed these packages you will only need to use the library function to call each package to use.

The \# sign is not part of the \texttt{R} code.
It is used by these authors to add comments to the \texttt{R} code and explain what each call is telling the program to do.
\texttt{R} will ignore everything after a \# sign when executing the code.

In the Martian Alphabet \texttt{RScript} file for the one proportion test, enter your class size (Q3 from the in-class activity) for sample\_size and the number of students who were correct in identifying Bumba (Q6 from the in-class activity) for as\_extreme\_as in the one\_proportion\_test.

There are two parts to study design: how the sample was selected and how the study was conducted. First, we will look at sampling and types of bias (selection, non-response, or response).

In these next questions, identify the target population, the sample selected, the variable, and the type of bias present.

The two main study designs we will cover are \textbf{observational studies} and \textbf{experiments}. Both the sampling method and the study design will help to determine the \textbf{scope of inference} for a study. Remember that only in a randomized experiment can we conclude a \textbf{causal} (cause and effect) relationship between the explanatory and response variable.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ScopeOfInferenceGreyscale} \end{center}

For the next exercises, identify the explanatory variable, the response variable, the study design (observational study or experiment), and the scope of inference (using the above chart).

  The pharmaceutical company Moderna Therapeutics is working in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health towards a vaccine for COVID-19 and has recently begun Phase 3 clinical trials. US clinical research sites will enroll 30,000 volunteers without COVID-19 to participate. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the candidate vaccine or a saline placebo. They will then be followed to assess vaccine-related symptoms and development of COVID-19. The trial is double-blind, so neither the investigators nor the participants will know who is assigned to which group.

When both these conditions are met, if we observe an association between the explanatory variable and the response variable in the data, we cannot be sure if this association is due to the explanatory variable or the confounding variable---the explanatory and confounding variables are ``confounded.''

In a study reported in Nature (1999, Vol. 399, pp.~113-114), a survey of 479 children found that those who had slept with a nightlight or in a fully lit room before the age of 2 had a higher incidence of nearsightedness (myopia) later in childhood.

In this study, there are two variables studied: \texttt{Light}: level of light in room at night (no light, night light, full light) and \texttt{Sight}: level of myopia developed later in childhood (high myopia, myopia, no myopia).

An important part of understanding data is to create visual pictures of what the data represent. In this activity, we will create graphical representations of categorical data.

``code chunks'' appear in gray. In the code chunk below, we

Open the provided \texttt{RScript} file for activity 3 in \texttt{RStudio} or \texttt{RStudioCloud} to answer the following questions. Highlight and run lines 1 - 5. These lines of code read in the data set and names the data set myopia. The library function tells \texttt{R} which packages will be needed.

If we wanted to know how many children in our data set were in each level of myopia, we would create a frequency bar plot of the variable \texttt{Sight}. Enter the variable name, \texttt{Sight}, for xx into the ggplot code to create a bar plot. Notice this is a \textbf{frequency} bar plot plotting counts (the number of children in each level of sight).

We could also choose to display the data as a proportion in a relative frequency bar plot. To find the relative frequency, divide the count in each level of myopia by the sample size. These are sample proportions. Notice that in this code we told \texttt{R} to create a bar plot with proportions.

To create a histogram of the IMDb scores, enter the variable name, \texttt{imdb\_score} in the provided \texttt{RScript} file for xx, highlight and run lines 1 - 15. Visually, this shows us the range of IMDb scores for Movies released in 2016.

Notice that the \textbf{bin width} is 0.5. For example the first bin consists of the number of movies in the data set with an IMDb score of 3.25 to 3.75. It is important to note that a movie with a IMDb score on the boundary of a bin will fall into the bin above it; for example, 4.76 would be counted in the bin 4.75--5.25.

The linear model function in \texttt{R} gives us the summary for the least squares regression line. The estimate for \texttt{(Intercept)} is the \(y\)-intercept for the line of least squares and the estimate for \texttt{budget\_mil} is the value of \(b_1\), the slope.

You may remember from middle and high school that slope \(=\frac{\mbox{rise}}{\mbox{run}}\).

Using \(b_1\) to represent slope, we can write that as the fraction \(\frac{b_1}{1}\).

Therefore, the slope predicts how much the line will \emph{rise} for each \emph{run} of +1. In other words, as the \(x\) variable increases by 1 unit, the \(y\) variable is expected to change (increase/decrease) by the value of slope.

The third summary measure from two quantitative variables is the coefficient of determination (\(r^2\)). The coefficient of determination, \(r^2\), can also be used to describe the strength of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. \(r^2\) measures the proportion of variation in the response that is explained by the least squares line with the explanatory variable. There are two ways to calculate the coefficient of determination:

~~~\(r^2 = (r)^2\) - square the value of the correlation coefficient

~~~\(r^2 = \frac{s_{response}^2 - s_{residuals}^2}{s_{response}^2}\) - using the variances

The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. In this random sample of 500 male professional boxers we want to see if there is an over-prevalence of left-handed fighters.

Remember that when utilizing a hypothesis test, we are evaluating two competing possibilities. For this study the \textbf{two possibilities} are either\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1 and our results just occurred by random chance or
\item
  The true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is greater than 0.1 and our results reflect this
\end{itemize}

Notice that these two competing possibilities represent the null and alternative hypotheses.

The null distribution is created under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. In this case, we assume the true proportion of male boxers who are left handed is 0.1 so we will create 1000 different simulations of 500 boxers under this assumption.

Let's think about how to use red and blue cards to create one simulation of 500 boxers under the assumption the null hypothesis is true. Suppose blue cards represents left-handed and red cards represents right-handed.

To use the computer simulation, we will need to enter the ``probability of success'' (\(\pi_0\)), ``sample size'' (the number of observational units or cases in the sample), ``number of repetitions'' (the number of samples to be generated), ``as extreme as'' (the observed statistic), and the ``direction'' (matches the direction of the alternative hypothesis).

The remaining questions cover theory based methods for testing a single categorical variable. Use section 5.3.3 in the textbook and the OnePropTheory video to complete the following questions.

A single proportion can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of \(\hat{p}\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Independence: The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample
\item
  Success-Failure Condition: We \emph{expect} to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, \(n\pi≥10\) and \(n(1-\pi)≥10\)
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We already verified that the independence condition is satisfied in Q8 Is the success-failure condition met to model the data with the Normal distribution? Show your work to support your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

To calculate the standardized statistic we use:

\[
Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}
\]
For a single categorical variable the standardized sample proportion is calculated using:

\[
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - \pi_0}{SE_0(\hat{p})}
\]
where the standard error is calculated using the null value.

\[SE_0(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)}{n}}\]
2. Calculate the null standard error of the sample proportion.

\hypertarget{handedness-of-male-boxers}{%
\section{Handedness of male boxers}\label{handedness-of-male-boxers}}

Last week, we found very strong evidence that the true proportion of male boxers who are left-handed is greater than the general population, 0.1. We will use this same study to estimate the parameter of interest. As a reminder: left-handedness is a trait that is found in about 10\% of the population. Past studies have shown that left-handed men are over-represented among professional boxers. The fighting claim states that left-handed men have an advantage in competition. Using the data from this random sample of 500 male boxers we want to estimate the true proportion of male boxers who are left-handed. Recall from the last activity in the sample of 500 male boxers, 81 were left-handed.

A \textbf{point estimate} provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible range of values for the parameter. This plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a confidence interval.

The remaining questions cover theory based methods for testing a single categorical variable. Use section 5.3.3 in the textbook and the OnePropTheory video to complete the following questions.

Recall that to use theory-based methods we must check the conditions to approximate the sample distribution with the Normal distribution. From the previous activity we saw that independence was satisfied as the researchers took a random sample.

For finding a confidence interval we need to be sure we have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in our \textbf{sample}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(n\hat{p}≥10\) and \(n(1-\hat{p})≥10\)

\item
  Verify that the success/failure condition is met to use theory based methods to find a 95\% confidence interval.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.5in}

To calculate the 95\% confidence interval we will find the standard error using the sample proportion.

\[SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}\]
To find the confidence interval we will add and subtract the margin of error to the point estimate.

\[\text{point estimate}\pm\text{margin of error}\]
\[\hat{p}\pm z^* SE(\hat{p})\]

\vspace{0.5in}

The \(z^*\) multiplier is found under the standard normal distribution. We find the values that encompass the middle 95\% of the distribution. If 95\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 5\% in the tails, or 2.5\% in each tail. The qnorm function in \texttt{R} will tell us the \(z^*\) value for the desired percentile (in this case, 95\% + 2.5\% = 97.5\% percentile).

To test the null hypothesis we could use simulation methods as we did with a single categorical variable in class. In this in-class activity we will focus on theory-based methods. Like with a single proportion, the difference in proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Independence: The data are independent within and between the two groups. (\emph{Remember}: This also must be true to use simulation methods!)
\item
  Success-Failure Condition: The success-failure condition holds for each group. Under the null hypothesis, the proportions \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\) are equal, so we check the success-failure condition with our best estimate of these values under \(H_0\), the pooled proportion from the two samples,

Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE}
\]

where the null standard error is calculated using the pooled proportion of successes.

SE_0(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)=\sqrt{\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\hat{p}_{pool})(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2})}, \text{  where}

\[
\hat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{number of "successes"}}{\text{number of cases}} = \frac{\hat{p}_1 n_1+\hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1+n_2}

Hypothesis tests are not flawless. In a hypothesis test, there are two competing hypotheses: the null and alternative. We make a decision about which might be true, but we may choose incorrectly.

In this in-class activity we will estimate the parameter of interest, the difference in true proportion of skiers and snowboarders with head injuries for those who wore helmets and those that did not, using theory-based methods.

In this activity we will focus on theory-based methods to calculate a confidence interval. Like with a single proportion, the difference in proportions can be mathematically modeled using the normal distribution if certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of \(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Independence: The data are independent within and between the two groups.
\item
  Success-Failure Condition: For a confidence interval, the success-failure condition holds for each group. All cells in the table have at least 10 observations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}

\item
  In activity 8, we saw that the independence condition was met since the study used a random sample. Is the success-failure condition to find the confidence interval met for each group? Explain your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1in}

To find a confidence interval for the difference in proportions we will add and subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to find the two endpoints.

\[\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2\pm z^*SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2), \text{where}\]

\[SE(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\hat{p}_1 (1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2 (1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}\right)}\]

Note that the formula changes when calculating the variability around the statistic in order to calculate a confidence interval from the formula used in activity 8! Here, use the sample proportions for each group to calculate the standard error for the difference in proportions.

The \(z^*\) multiplier is found under the standard normal distribution. We find the values that encompass the middle 95\% of the distribution. If 95\% of the standard normal distribution should be in the middle, that leaves 5\% in the tails, or 2.5\% in each tail. The qnorm function in \texttt{R} will tell us the \(z^*\) value for the desired percentile (in this case, 95\% + 2.5\% = 97.5\% percentile).

\section{COVID-19 and air pollution}\label{covid-19-and-air-pollution-1}}

In June 2020, the social distancing efforts and stay-at-home directives to help combat the spread of COVID-19 appeared to help `flatten the curve' across the United States, albeit at a high cost to many individuals and businesses. The impact of these measures, though, goes far beyond the infection and death rates from the disease. You may have seen images comparing air quality in large international cities like Rome, Milan, Wuhan, and New Delhi such as the one pictured in Figure @ref\{fig:covid\}, which seem to indicate, perhaps unsurprisingly, that fewer people driving and factories being shut down have reduced air pollutants.

Have high population-density US cities seen the same improved air quality conditions? To study this question, data was gathered from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) AirData website which records the ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values for cities across the U.S. These measures are used to calculate an air quality index (AQI) score for each city each day of the year. Thirty-three of the most densely populated US cities were selected and the AQI score recorded for April 20, 2020 as well as the five-year median AQI score for April 20th (2015--2019). Note that higher AQI scores indicate worse air quality. A box plot of the differences in AQI scores for the 33 cities and a table of summary statistics are shown below.

To simulate the null distribution we will use a bootstrapping method. Recall that the null distribution must be created under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, before bootstrapping we will need to shift each data point by the difference \(\mu_0 - \bar{x}\).

The remaining questions cover theory-based methods for testing paired quantitative data. Use section 6.2.3 in the textbook and the OneMeanTheory video to complete the following questions.

The sampling distribution for \(\bar{x}\) based on a sample of size \(n\) from a population with a true mean \(\mu\) and true standard deviation \(\sigma\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of \(\bar{x}\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Independence: The sample's observations are independent
\item
  Normality: data should be approximately normal
\end{itemize}

** n \textless{} 30: If the sample size n is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.

** n ≥ 30: If the sample size n is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  In the in-class activity we verified that the independence condition was satisfied. Is the normality condition met to use the theory-based methods for analysis? Explain your answer.

\section{Weather patterns and record snowfall}\label{weather-patterns-and-record-snowfall-1}}

In the winter of 2018-2019, Bozeman had a record snowfall which resulted in the collapse of two flat-roofed buildings on the MSU campus. A writer for the Washington Post predicted the heavy snowfall for 2018-2019 due to the El Ni\~{n}o weather pattern that occurred in that season. A meteorologist in Montana wanted to see if the weather pattern really was associated with total snowfall. She obtained historical data from 44 years on the weather pattern (El Ni\~{n}o or La Ni\~{n}a) and snowfall (in inches) at the Billings Weather Station.

Notice from the \texttt{R} code that the name of the data set is \texttt{Snow}.

\section{Out of Class Activity}\label{out-of-class-activity}}

The remaining questions cover inference for a difference in means using theory based methods. Use section 6.3.3 in the textbook and the TwoMeanTheory video to complete the following questions.

The sampling distribution for \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\) can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.

Conditions for the sample distribution of \(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Independence: The sample's observations are independent
\item
  Normality: each sample should be approximately normal
\end{itemize}

For each sample:
** n \textless{} 30: If the sample size n is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.

** n ≥ 30: If the sample size n is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \(\bar{x}\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.

In question 21 in the in-class activity we noted that there were issues with the normality condition.

\vspace{1in}

To find the Standardized Statistic for the difference in means:

~~~~\(T = \frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2}{SE(\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2)}\)

where the standard error of the mean difference

~~~~\(SE(\bar{x}_1 -\bar{x}_2)=\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\)

\section{Moneyball}\label{moneyball-1}}

The goal of a Major League baseball team is to make the playoffs. In 2002, the manager of the Oakland A's, Billy Beane with the help of Paul DePodesta began to use statistics to determine which players to choose for their season. Based on past data, Paul determined that to make it to the playoffs, the A's would need to win at least 95 games in regular season. They also analyzed the relationship between number of runs and number of wins. The Oakland A's won 20 consecutive games and a total of 103 for the season. The success of this use of sports analytics was portrayed by the 2011 movie, \emph{Moneyball}.

In this study we will see if there is a positive linear relationship between the difference in the number of runs scored minus the number of runs allowed and the number of wins for teams in the years before 2002.

Some of the variables collected in this data set consist of the following:

When performing inference on a least squares line, the follow conditions are generally required

\begin{itemize}

  Linearity: the data should follow a linear trend
\item
  Nearly normal residuals: residuals must be nearly normal
\item
  Constant variability: the variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant
\item

First let's think about how one simulation would be created on the null distribution using cards. First we would write the values for the response variable, wins, on each card.
