\setstretch{1}


### Learning outcomes

* Identify whether a study is a paired design or independent groups

* Given a research question involving one categorical explanatory variable and one quantitative response variable, construct the null and alternative hypotheses
  in words and using appropriate statistical symbols.

* Describe and perform a hypothesis test for a difference in means.

* Interpret and evaluate a p-value for a hypothesis test for a difference in means.

* Find a confidence interval for a difference in means.

* Interpret a confidence interval for a difference in means.

### Type of samples

For each of the following scenarios, determine whether the samples are paired or independent.

1. Researchers interested in studying the effect of a medical treatment on insulin rate measured insulin rates of 30 patients before and after the medical treatment.

2.  **A university is planning to bring emotional support animals to campus during finals week and wants to determine which type of animals are more effective at calming students.  Anxiety levels will be measured before and after each student interacts with either a dog or a cat.  The university will then compare change in anxiety levels between the 'dog' people and the 'cat' people.**

3.  An industry leader is investigating a possible wage gap between male and non-male employees.  Twenty companies within the industry are randomly selected and the average salary for all males and non-males in mid-management positions is recorded for each company.

### Dinosaurs

The backbone of heavy, two-legged, carnivorous dinosaurs, such as the T. rex, is subject to stress. Intriguingly, these dinosaurs have protrusions (rugosity) at the top and sides of their spinal vertebrae, potentially for extra support. These protrusions do not seem to be present in smaller carnivorous dinosaurs. MSU paleontologists hypothesize that the presence of the protrusions is associated with the size of the two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs, potentially allowing them to grow big [@wilson2016]. To test this hypothesis, the researchers collected multiple scientific papers describing the fossil bones of 57 two-legged carnivorous dinosaur species. Then, they checked for the presence or absence of these rugose protrusions from photographs published in the papers and collected measurements of the length in centimeters of the femur (or thigh) bone. Femur length is a proxy for dinosaur size. Is there evidence that the presence of the protusions result in larger dinosaurs?  Use present $-$ absent as the order of subtraction.

4.  Write out the null hypothesis in proper notation for this study.  

\vspace{0.6in}

5.  What sign ($<$, $>$, or $\neq$) would you use in the alternative hypothesis for this study?  Explain your choice.

\vspace{0.4in}

Upload and open the R script file for Week 12 lab. Upload and import the csv file, `dinosaur`. Enter the name of the data set (see the environment tab) for datasetname in the R script file in line 6 and the name of the explanatory and response variable in line 8. Highlight and run lines 1--13 to load the data and create a plot of the data. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dinos <- datasetname
dino %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = response, x = explanatory)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Side-by-side box plots of femur length by rugosity",
       x = "Rugose structures on the backbone",
       y = "Femur length (cm)")
```

6. Based on the plots, does there appear to be some evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis?  How do you know?
\vspace{0.4in}

Enter the name of the explanatory variable for `explanatory` and the response variable for `response` in line 17.  Run lines 16--17 to find the summary statistics.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dinos %>% 
    summarize(favstats(response~explanatory))
```


7.  Calculate the summary statistic for the research question. Use proper notation.
\vspace{0.25in}

8. **How far, on average, is each difference in femur length from the difference in mean femur length?  What is the appropriate notation for this value?**

### Use statistical inferential methods to draw inferences from the data {-}

9.  Using the provided graphs and summary statistics, determine if both theory-based methods and simulation methods could be used to analyze the data.  Explain your reasoning.

\vspace{0.8in}

### Hypothesis test {-}

Remember that the null distribution is created based on the assumption the null hypothesis is true.  In this study, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference in mean femur length for dinosaurs with protusions and dinosaurs without protusions.

We will use the `two_mean_test()` function in R (in the `catstats` package) to simulate the null distribution of differences in sample means and compute a p-value. 

10.  Simulate a null distribution and compute the p-value. Using the R script file for this lab, enter the correct values in place of the `xx`'s to produce the null distribution with 1000 simulations.  Highlight and run lines 20--25.  

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
two_mean_test(response~explanatory, #Enter the names of the variables
              data = dinos,  # Enter the name of the dataset
              first_in_subtraction = "xx", # First outcome in order of subtraction
              number_repetitions = 1000,  # Number of simulations
              as_extreme_as = xx,  # Observed statistic
              direction = "xx")  # Direction of alternative: "greater", "less", or "two-sided"
```
|        Sketch the null distribution created using the `two_mean_test` code.

### Communicate the results and answer the research question {-}

11.  **Report the p-value. Based off of this p-value and a 1% significance level, what decision would you make about the null hypothesis?  What potential error might you be making based on that decision?**

\vspace{0.5in}

12. Do you expect the 98\% confidence interval to contain the null value of zero?  Explain.

\vspace{0.8in}

### Confidence interval {-}

We will use the `paired_bootstrap_CI()` function in R (in the `catstats` package) to simulate the bootstrap distribution of sample mean differences and calculate a confidence interval. 

13. Using bootstrapping and the provided R script file, find a 98\% confidence interval. Fill in the missing values/numbers in the `two_mean_bootstrap_CI()` function to create the 98\% confidence interval.  Highlight and run lines 28--32. **Upload a copy of the bootstrap distribution created to Gradescope for your group.** 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
two_mean_bootstrap_CI(response ~ explanatory, #Enter the name of the variables
                      data = dinos,  # Enter the name of the data set
                      first_in_subtraction = "xx", # First value in order of subtraction
                      number_repetitions = 1000,  # Number of simulations
                      confidence_level = xx)
```

|        Sketch the bootstrap distribution created using the code.  Report the 98\% confidence interval in interval notation.

14. Interpret the *confidence level* of the interval you calculated in question 13.
